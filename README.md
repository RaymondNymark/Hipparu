# What is Hipparu?
 
Hipparu is a replacement for the venerable CSUS.edu Drag-n-Drop exercises that can be found here: 
 - https://www.csus.edu/indiv/s/sheaa/projects/genki/katakana-timer.html
 - https://www.csus.edu/indiv/s/sheaa/projects/genki/hiragana-timer.html
 
The main difference between the two is that you may swap freely between alphabets, rather than having two different applications for the exercises. 
 
# Why do they need replaced?

Flash is no longer supported, and the average Japanese learner who might have enjoyed this resource might not have the know-how to run a local emulator. It's just simpler to make a more modern solution. 

# Where is it hosted?

Using Github Pages, it will be available at https://hipparu.com

がんばってください！
