# How do I play Hipparu?
Simply go to https://hipparu.com where you can play a version hosted with GitHub Pages. Alternatively you can build it yourself from source, or configure the workflow to work with your fork. 

# What is Hipparu?
 
Hipparu is a replacement for the venerable CSUS.edu Drag-n-Drop exercises that can be found here: 
 - https://www.csus.edu/indiv/s/sheaa/projects/genki/katakana-timer.html
 - https://www.csus.edu/indiv/s/sheaa/projects/genki/hiragana-timer.html
 
This makes it one Web Application with a few different ways to play the game. 
 
# Why do they need replaced?

Flash is no longer supported, and the average Japanese learner who might have enjoyed this resource might not have the know-how to run a local emulator. It's just simpler to make a more modern solution. 

がんばってください！
